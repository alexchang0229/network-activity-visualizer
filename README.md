# Network activity visualizer
I 3D printed a [geodesic dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome) and hooked up some flashing LEDs and fiber optic cables to visualize the nearby network activity, it looks pretty cool in the dark.

I used an ESP-32 in promiscuous mode to sniff WiFi packets and get their MAC addresses, and 40 individually addressable LEDs that flash when a packet is detected.
## How
To assemble the geodesic sphere, I printed 30 x hexagonal joints and 12 x pentagonal joints. They are joined with 3/16" wooden dowels, cut 60 dowels 155 mm long and 60 dowels 164 mm long.
